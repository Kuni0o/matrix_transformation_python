# Python Project for Matrix Transformations and Visualization of a Unit Square

## Project Overview

This Python project enables users to calculate transformation matrices and visualize the transformation of a unit square using Matplotlib.

## Features
* Calculate a transformation matrix based on entered new coordinates of a unit square.
* Visualize a transformed unit square based on entered transformation matrices using Matplotlib.

## Usage
* Clone the repository and run 'main.py' inside terminal in correct directory using 'python main.py'

## Requirements
* Matplotlib

## Visualization
In the plot generated by Matplotlib:
The old point (0, 0) is located at the intersection of the red and green lines. 
The old point (0, 1) is at the opposite end of the red line. 
The old point (1, 0) is at the opposite end of the green line.
